# Star Citizen Space Combat Communication Protocol

## How to run
Open `index.html` directly in your browser (double-click). No build tools or servers required.

## Admin lock disclaimer (important)
This is a **static offline site**. Edit mode is a convenience toggle intended to prevent accidental edits. It is **not true security** and does not protect against someone who can open and edit the files directly.

## Online build (static hosting)
Open the editor, click **Edit**, and use **Generate Online Build** in the admin panel to download a hosting-ready ZIP. The online build includes a subtle admin login link at the bottom of the page that unlocks edit mode using the credentials you set in the offline editor.

## Security note
Because this is a static HTML/CSS/JS project, the online login is **client-side only** and not real security. For production hosting, add server-side protection (basic auth/htpasswd or platform password protection).
